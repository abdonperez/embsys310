BBQ Pellet Smoker
When cooking with my pellet smoker, I set the temperature and amount of smoke I want used.  Using a temperature probe inside the pit, the system must maintain the desired temperature by managing the number of pellets that get sent into the flame to generate the appropriate heat and smoke.

One challenge of this system would be controlling the temperature with varied external elements, such as the temperature around the pit (ambient temperatures).
