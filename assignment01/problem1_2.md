1. Embedded device example Using the telegraph example, and the challenges listed in the module as reference, and describe another device that you would like to discuss. Describe how you think its embedded system works, and what design challenges it presents. 

BBQ Pellet Smoker
When cooking with my pellet smoker, I set the temperature and amount of smoke I want used.  Using a temperature probe inside the pit, the system must maintain the desired temperature by managing the number of pellets that get sent into the flame to generate the appropriate heat and smoke.
One challenge of this system would be controlling the temperature with varied external elements, such as the temperature around the pit (ambient temperatures).

2. Two’s complement
Why use two’s complement to represent negative numbers?

Using 2s complement is the most efficient way to represent signed integers in hardware.  2s complement.  Plus, it is easier to implement using 2n calculations.  Other methods introduce more complexity, for example, 1s complement has two ways of representing 0 (+0 and -0).
